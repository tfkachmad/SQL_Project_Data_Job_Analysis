# üìä Background
The demand for data analysts continues to grow, but not all roles offer the same opportunities. Some positions pay significantly more, while certain skills are more in demand than others. This project aims to answer:

- üí∞ **What are the top-paying jobs for data analysts?**
- üõ† **What skills are required for these high-paying roles?**
- üìà **What are the most in-demand skills in the industry?**
- üîç **Which skills correlate with higher salaries?**
- üéØ **What are the most optimal skills to 
learn?** (*High demand & high pay!*)

By analyzing job postings, this project helps identify the most valuable skills and career paths for data analysts in 2023.

## üõ† Tools I Used  

For this project, I used the following tools to analyze job posting data efficiently:  

- **SQL** ‚Äì To query, clean, and analyze job market data  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì The relational database used to store and manage data  
- **VS Code** ‚Äì The code editor for writing and editing SQL queries  
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì For version control, collaboration, and sharing the project  

These tools helped streamline the data exploration process, ensuring efficient querying and reproducibility.  

# The Analysis

## 1. üí∞ Top Paying Data Analyst Job

### üîç What I Did  
To identify the highest-paying data analyst roles in 2023, I queried job postings and ranked them based on their **average annual salary**. The dataset includes information such as **company name, job title, salary, location, job posting platform, and posting date**.  

```sql
SELECT 
    jobs.job_id,
    company.company_id,
    company.name AS company_name,
    jobs.job_title,
    jobs.job_location,
    jobs.job_via,
    jobs.job_schedule_type,
    jobs.job_posted_date,
    jobs.salary_year_avg
FROM job_postings_fact AS jobs
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS company 
    ON jobs.company_id = company.company_id
WHERE jobs.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND jobs.job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND jobs.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY jobs.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

    ROUND(AVG(jobs.salary_year_avg), 0) AS annual_salary_avg_usd
FROM job_postings_fact AS jobs 
JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job 
    ON jobs.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
JOIN skills_dim AS skills 
    ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id
WHERE jobs.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND jobs.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills.skill_id, skill_name
HAVING COUNT(skills.skill_id) > 100
ORDER BY demand_count DESC;
```

*This scatter chart visualizes the relationship between skill demand and average salary for data analysts. The chart is divided into four quadrants, categorizing skills based on their demand in the job market and associated salary levels.*

### üìä Insights from the Data

### **New Insights from the Quadrant Analysis**  

Analyzing the scatter plot of skill demand vs. salary reveals several strategic takeaways for an aspiring data analyst:  

1. **The "Sweet Spot" ‚Äì SQL, Python, and Tableau**  
   - These skills fall in the high-demand and high-salary quadrant, making them excellent investments.  
   - SQL remains the most in-demand skill, while Python and Tableau command strong salaries, making them a powerful trio to master.  

2. **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools: High Demand, Moderate Salary**  
   - **Power BI and Tableau** are widely used in analytics but offer moderate salaries compared to programming-focused skills.  
   - This suggests that BI skills are essential for reporting roles but should be complemented with SQL or Python to maximize career growth.  

3. **Niche Technologies = High Pay, Low Demand**  
   - Skills like **Spark, Terraform, and Snowflake** offer some of the highest salaries but are not as commonly required.  
   - Learning these can be a smart move if targeting specialized roles in data engineering or cloud analytics.  

4. **Foundational Office Tools Still Matter**  
   - **Excel, PowerPoint, and Word** remain relevant but fall into the high-demand, lower-salary quadrant.  
   - While they won‚Äôt differentiate a data analyst, they are still expected skills for business reporting.  

5. **Low-Demand, Low-Salary Skills ‚Äì Not Worth the Investment**  
   - Some skills, like **Outlook and SharePoint**, do not offer strong salary incentives or demand in analytics roles.  
   - For career growth, prioritizing technical skills over administrative tools is a better approach.  

## üìö **What I Learned from This Project**  

1. **Breaking Down Complex Questions into SQL Queries**  
   - This project required **extracting insights from a large dataset**, so I had to break down each question into smaller, manageable SQL queries.  
   - I used **CTEs and subqueries** to structure my queries efficiently, especially when calculating demand, salaries, and skill occurrences across different job roles.  

2. **Using Aggregate Functions to Derive Insights**  
   - To find the most in-demand skills and highest-paying skills, I applied **COUNT() and AVG() functions**, grouping data based on skills and job roles.  
   - **ORDER BY and LIMIT** helped in ranking results, ensuring I could identify the top skills efficiently.  

3. **Combining Multiple Tables with Joins**  
   - Since the data was spread across different tables (skills, salaries, job postings), I used **INNER JOINs and LEFT JOINs** to merge relevant data.  
   - This approach allowed me to **connect salary data with skill demand**, providing a comprehensive view of which skills offer the best balance of demand and salary.  

4. **Filtering and Optimizing Queries for Better Performance**  
   - Using **WHERE clauses** helped filter relevant data, especially when focusing on specific job roles like "Data Analyst."  
   - **Indexing and optimizing queries** became essential as some tables contained large amounts of data, ensuring the queries ran efficiently.  

5. **Deriving Business Insights from Raw Data**  
   - Beyond just writing queries, I learned how to **interpret results in a meaningful way**, turning raw numbers into actionable insights.  
   - This reinforced the importance of **aligning SQL analysis with business objectives**, ensuring the findings are useful for decision-making.  

This project strengthened my ability to **write complex SQL queries, optimize performance, and extract meaningful insights from structured data**‚Äîvaluable skills for any data analyst role! üöÄ

# Conclusions

Through this project, I explored various aspects of data analyst job trends using SQL, uncovering key insights about salaries, skill demand, and their relationship. Here are five of the most interesting findings:  

1.  **SQL is the Most In-Demand Skill** ‚Äì Across job listings, SQL consistently appeared as the most sought-after skill, reinforcing its importance for data analysts. Excel and Python followed closely, emphasizing the need for both technical and business-oriented tools.  

2.  **Python and SQL Lead in High-Paying Roles** ‚Äì While SQL is the most in-demand, Python frequently appears in top-paying data analyst jobs. This suggests that analysts with programming expertise can access higher-paying opportunities.  

3.  **High Salaries Often Come from Specialized or Niche Skills** ‚Äì Some of the highest-paying skills, such as **Solidity, Terraform, and DataRobot**, are not as commonly required but command premium salaries, likely due to their specialized nature.  

4. **Demand Doesn‚Äôt Always Correlate with Salary** ‚Äì Skills like **Power BI and Tableau** are highly in demand but don‚Äôt necessarily offer the highest salaries. Meanwhile, niche technologies like **Snowflake and Spark** have fewer job postings but offer higher compensation.  

5. **Identifying the Best Skill Investment** ‚Äì Based on the quadrant analysis, skills like **SQL, Python, and Snowflake** offer a strong balance of demand and salary, making them valuable choices for career development.  

These insights help in making data-driven decisions about which skills to prioritize for career growth in data analytics. üöÄ
